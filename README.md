README
  My application is named "TranswithKhoi" in which Trans stands for 
  Translate and Khoi is my name.
  
  My application is written on Python kivy and using Google Translate
  API.

  With TranswithKhoi, you can translate from any languages into 
  English, French, Germanm, Italian, Russian and Vietnamese.

  Adding more target languages is possible. However, it may degrade
  the neatness of the UI so I decide to add only six languages.

  I have built a .apk file to install app on Android. Unfortunately,
  it is crashed.
